# Technical Concepts

The following sections cover essential concepts to develop automation using the framework.

1. **[Resources]**: An any-map, whose values' read and write access are checked at runtime instead of compile time.
2. **[Function graph]**: Functions with logical and data-access-dependent concurrency.
3. **[Item]**: Specification that defines information and logic to manage an *arbitrary item*.
4. **[Item graph]**: Like a function graph, where each node is not just a function, but an item.
