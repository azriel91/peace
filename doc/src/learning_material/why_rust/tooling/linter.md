[Clippy lints index](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html)

<div class="hidden">

1. Rust ships with a linter
2. It's called clippy, also a very original name.
3. If you write the code on the left, it will tell you to write code on the right.
4. This is really nice because it's teaching you how to write cleaner code.

5. Clippy has over 9000 lints.
