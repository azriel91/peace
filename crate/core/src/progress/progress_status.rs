/// Status of an item's execution progress.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// ## Variants
///
/// The following variant is possible conceptually, but not applicable to the
/// Peace framework:
///
/// `Stopped`: Task is not running, but can be started.
///
/// This is not applicable because Peace uses runtime borrowing to manage state,
/// and a stopped task has potentially altered data non-atomically, so locking
/// the data is not useful, and unlocking the data may cause undefined behaviour
/// due to reasoning over inconsistent state.
///
/// For rate limiting tasks, the task in its entirety would be held back.
///
/// ## `!Copy`
///
/// This type isn't `Copy`, because one way wish to include detail about the
/// function to render as part of the progress output, and that detail may not
/// be `Copy` -- not sure yet.

    ///
    /// * **Units total:** Unknown (spinner) / known (progress bar).
    /// * **Units current**
    /// * **Function:** `Item::{state_current, state_goal, apply}`.
    ///

    ///     is feature gated, then the function won't be available when the
    ///     feature is not enabled.

    /// the user.
