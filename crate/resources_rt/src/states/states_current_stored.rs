/// # use std::path::PathBuf;

/// # use peace_data::{Data, R};
/// #
/// /// Predecessor `TryFnSpec::Data`.
/// #[derive(Data, Debug)]
/// pub struct AppUploadParams<'exec> {
///     /// Path to the application directory.
///     app_dir: W<'exec, PathBuf>,
/// }

/// /// Successor `TryFnSpec::Data`.
