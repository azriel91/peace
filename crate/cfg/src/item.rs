/// Defines all of the data and logic to manage an item.
///
/// The item may be simple or complex, ranging from:
///
/// * File download.
/// * Application installation.
/// * Server launching / initialization.
/// * Multiple cloud resource management.
///
/// The lifecycle functions include:
///
/// 1. Status discovery.
/// 2. Execution.
/// 3. Backup.
/// 4. Restoration.
/// 5. Clean up / deletion.
///
/// Since the latter four functions are write-operations, their specification
/// includes a dry run function.
///
/// # Logical IDs vs Physical IDs
///
/// A logical ID is defined by code, and does not change. A physical ID is one
/// generated during execution, which may be random or computed.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// The following are examples of logical IDs and corresponding physical
/// IDs:
///
/// * If the function creates a file, the ID *may* be the full file path, or it
///   may be the file name, assuming the file path may be deduced by the clean
///   up logic from [`Data`].
///
/// * If the function instantiates a virtual machine on a cloud platform, this
///   may be the ID of the instance so that it may be terminated.
///
/// | Logical ID               | Physical ID                            |
