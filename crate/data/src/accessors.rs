//! Accessors to fetch data from `Resources`.
//!
//! * `R<'_, T>`: Immutable access to a `T` resource.
//! * `W<'_, T>`: Mutable access to a `T` resource.
//! * `RMaybe<'_, T>`: Immutable access to a `T` resource, if it has been
//!   inserted.
//! * `WMaybe<'_, T>`: Mutable access to a `T` resource, if it has been
//!   inserted.
//! * `ROpt<'_, T>`: Immutable access to an `Option<T>` resource.
//! * `WOpt<'_, T>`: Mutable access to an `Option<T>` resource.
//!
//! Notably if you want to insert a resource during item execution, you
//! should use `WOpt` instead of `WMaybe`, and correspondingly read it using
//! `ROpt`.
