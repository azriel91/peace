/// ## List Presentation
///
/// For output to be formatted aesthetically, certain formatters require the
/// presented width of a list's entries to be known.
///
/// However, the width of a `Presentable` entry's presentation can only be known
/// when it is `present`ed, which requires rendering to an in-memory buffer,
/// tracking the character count, then copying from that buffer to the actual
/// output.
///
/// Currently Peace does not support this staged approach, and instead streams
/// each entry to the presenter as it is added. The benefit of this approach is
/// the presentation can be rendered without needing intermediate data to be
/// held in memory for each entry.
