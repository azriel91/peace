/// Map of `State`s for all `Item`s. `TypeMap<ItemId, Item::State>` newtype.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `TS`: Type state to distinguish the purpose of the `States` map.
///
/// # Serialization
///
/// [`StatesSerde`] is used for serialization and deserialization.
///
/// # Design
///
/// When states are serialized, we want there to be an entry for each item.
///
/// 1. This means the `States` map should contain an entry for each item,
///    regardless of whether a `State` is recorded for that item.
///
/// 2. Inserting an `Option<_>` layer around the `Item::State` turns the map
///    into a `Map<ItemId, Option<Item::State>>`.
///
/// 3. Calling `states.get(item_id)` returns `Option<Option<Item::State>>`, the
///    outer layer for whether the item had an entry, and the inner layer for
///    whether there was any `State` recorded.
///
/// 4. If we can guarantee the item ID is valid -- an ID of an item in the flow
///    -- we could remove that outer `Option` layer. Currently we cannot make
///    this guarantee, as:
///
///     - item IDs are constructed by developer code, without any constraints
///       for which items are inserted into the Flow, and which are inserted
///       into `States` -- although insertion into `States` is largely managed
///       by `peace`.
///
///     - `States` may contain different items across different versions of an
///       automation tool, so it is possible (and valid) to:
///
///         + Deserialize `States` that contain states for `Item`s that are no
///           longer in the flow.
///         + Deserialize `States` that do not contain states for `Item`s that
///           are newly added to the flow.
///         + Have a combination of the above for renamed items.
///
/// 5. For clarity of each of these `Option` layers, we can wrap them in a
///    newtype.
///
/// 6. For code cleanliness, this additional layer requires calling
///    [`flatten()`] on `states.get(item_id)`.
///
/// 7. We *could* introduce a different type during serialization that handles
///    this additional layer, to remove the additional `flatten()`. How do we
///    handle flow upgrades smoothly?
///
///     - **Development:** Compile time API support with runtime errors may be
///       sufficient.
///     - **User:** Developers *may* require users to decide how to migrate
///       data. This use case hopefully is less common.
///
/// ## `StatesSerde` Separate Type
///
/// Newtype for `Map<ItemId, Option<Item::State>>`.
///
/// ### Item Additions
///
/// * Flow contains the `Item`.
/// * Stored state doesn't contain an entry for the item.
/// * Deserialized `StatesSerde` should contain `(item_id!("new"), None)` -- may
///   need custom deserialization code.
///
/// ### Item Removals
///
/// * Flow does not contain the `Item`.
/// * Stored state contains an entry for the item, but cannot be deserialized.
/// * Deserialized `StatesSerde` would not contain any entry.
/// * Deserialization will return the unable to be deserialized item state in
///   the return value. Meaning, `StatesSerde` will contain it in a separate
///   "removed" field.
///
/// After deserialization, `StatesSerde` is explicitly mapped into `States`, and
/// we can inform the developer and/or user of the removed items if it is
/// useful.
///
/// ## `States` With Optional Item State
///
/// Developers will frequently use `states.get(item_id).flatten()` to access
/// state.
///
/// Deserialization has all the same properties as the `StatesSerde` separate
/// type. However, the entries that fail to be deserialized are retained in the
/// `States` type (or are lost, if we deliberately ignore entries that fail to
/// be deserialized).
///
/// Should `Flow`s be versionable, and we migrate them to the latest version as
/// encountered? If so, then:
///
/// * `peace` should store the version of the flow in the stored states files
/// * items that have ever been used in flows must be shipped in the automation
///   software, in order to support safe upgrades.
///
/// How would this work?
///
/// * Newly added items just work.
/// * Removed items need to be removed:
///     - Successors may need their parameters specified from new predecessors.
///     - If removing multiple items, we need to clean them in reverse.
/// * Renamed items may need to be re-applied, or potentially cleaned and
///   re-ensured. This doesn't support data retention if a predecessor needs to
///   be cleaned, forcing successors to be cleaned, and reensured after. Unless,
///   `peace` supports backup and restore.
///
