//! Manages running a shell command for the peace framework.
//!
//! This item is designed to take in separate shell commands for each of
//! the following:
//!
//! * Current state logic, whose stdout defines the current state (`String`).
//! * Goal state logic, whose stdout defines the goal state (`String`).
//! * State diff logic, whose stdout defines the state difference.
//! * Ensure check, whose stdout defines if ensure execution needs to run --
//!   `true` means execution is required, `false` means execution is required.
//! * Ensure execution, whose stdout defines state physical.
//! * Clean check, whose exit status defines if clean execution needs to run --
//!   `true` means execution is required, `false` means execution is required.
//! * Clean execution.
