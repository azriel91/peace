`peace` is a framework to build empathetic and forgiving software automation.

See:

* [peace.mk](https://peace.mk) for the project vision.
* [Background](https://peace.mk/book/background.html) for the motivation to create this framework.
* [Operations UX](https://azriel.im/ops_ux/) for a book about the dimensions considered during `peace`'s design and development.


## Guiding Principles

* A joy to use.
* Ergonomic API and guidance to do the right thing.
* Understandable output.


## Features

| Symbol | Meaning              |
|:------:|:---------------------|
|   🟢   | Works well           |
|   🟡   | Partial support      |
|   ⚫   | Planned              |
|   🔵   | Compatible by design |
|   🟣   | Works, "fun idea"    |

* 🟢 **Idempotent:** Multiple invocations result in the goal outcome.
* 🟢 **Clean:** Every item creation is paired with how it is cleaned up.
* 🟢 **Understandable:** Progress is shown at an understandable level of detail.
* 🔵 **Understandable:** Error reporting is compatible with [`miette`].
* 🟡 **Interruptible:** Execution can be interrupted.
* 🟢 **Resumable:** Automation resumes where it was interrupted.
* 🟢 **Diffable:** States and diffs are serialized as YAML.
* 🟢 **Efficient:** Tasks are concurrently executed via [`fn_graph`].
* 🟢 **Namespaced:** Profile directories isolate environments from each other.
* 🟢 **Type Safe:** Items and parameters are defined in code, not configuration.

### Roadmap

* 🟢 Define items to manage with automation.
* 🟢 Define dependencies between items.
* 🟢 Define "apply" logic.
* 🟢 Define "clean up" logic.
* 🟢 Discover current and goal states.
* 🟢 Define diff calculation between states.
* 🟢 Store and recall parameters across commands.
* 🟢 Diff states between multiple profiles.
* 🟢 Type-safe referential parameters -- specify usage of values generated during automation as parameters to subsequent items.
* 🟡 Feature-gated incremental functionality.
* 🟡 Off-the-shelf support for common items.
* 🟡 Dry run.
* 🟣 WASM support.
* ⚫ Cancel-safe interruption via [`tokio-graceful-shutdown`].
* ⚫ Secure-by-design Support: Encrypted value storage, decrypted per execution / time based agent.
* ⚫ Tutorial for writing a software lifecycle management tool.
* ⚫ Built-in application execution methods -- CLI, web service.
* ⚫ `peace` binary for configuration based workflows.
* ⚫ Web based UI with interactive graph.
* ⚫ Agent mode to run `peace` on servers (Web API invocation).

Further ideas:

* Back up current state.
* Restore previous state.
* Telemetry / metrics logging for analysis.

## Examples

Examples are run using `--package` instead of `--example`, as each example is organized as its own crate.

```bash
cargo run --package $example_name --all-features

# e.g.
cargo build --package download --all-features
cargo run -q --package download --all-features -- init https://ifconfig.me ip.json

for cmd in status goal diff ensure ensure diff clean clean diff
do
    printf "=== ${cmd} ===\n"
    cargo run -q --package download --all-features -- --format text $cmd
    printf '\n'
done

# Look at metadata that Peace has saved
find .peace -type f -exec bash -c 'echo \# {}; cat {}; echo' \;

# Clean up the metadata directory
rm -rf .peace
```

### WASM

The `download` example can be built as a web assembly application using [`wasm-pack`]:

```bash
cd examples/download
wasm-pack build --target web
```

In the `examples/download` directory, start an [HTTP server], and open <http://localhost:8000/>:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 # or
simple-http-server --nocache --port 8000 -i
```
